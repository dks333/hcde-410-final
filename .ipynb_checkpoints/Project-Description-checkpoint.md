# Project Description

## Motivation
The propose of doing this analysis is to understand how NFT grows in the marketplace over the last several years. From human-centered perspective, NFT plays a significant role in Web 3.0 because it cannot be replicated and only owned by one wallet address. It also helps artists release their artwork and claim its ownership without worring about piracy. I hope to learn about the growth of NFT over the last several years and also the reasons that lead to such growth. **The overall research goal is to understand the patterns and growth in the NFT marketplace.** 

## Data
Dataset contains sale dates, the cumulative sales in USD, number of sales, active market wallets, primary sales, secondary sales, average sales in USD, cumulative number of sales, etc. By analyzing this dataset, we can understand how NFT marketplace changes over the years.
